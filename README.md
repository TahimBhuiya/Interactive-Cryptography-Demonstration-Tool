# Practical Aspects of Modern Cryptography Final Project

**By Tahim Bhuiya**

---

## Overview

This Python script provides a collection of cryptographic functionalities implemented in Python, including:

- ElGamal encryption  
- DES encryption  
- 3DES encryption  
- Blum-Goldwasser encryption  
- Hybridized encryption with ElGamal/DES and ElGamal/3DES

---

## Dependencies

- **JupyterLab**  
  This project assumes that the user has access to JupyterLab. If not, either install it or run the code using another IDE that supports Streamlit.

- **Python 3.x**

- **streamlit**  
  Download with:  
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit
  ```

- **numpy**

- **math** (built-in)

- **random** (built-in)

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code and open it in JupyterLab.  
   (A `.txt` version of the code is also provided if you need to paste it.)

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using Python.

4. Open a terminal in the same directory while the code is up and type:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Practical_Aspects_of_Modern_Cryptography_Final_Project.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompts for input on the different encryption schemes implemented. Instructions will vary by scheme.

6. The script will generate keys, encrypt the plaintext, and decrypt the ciphertext, displaying the results depending on the scheme selected.
