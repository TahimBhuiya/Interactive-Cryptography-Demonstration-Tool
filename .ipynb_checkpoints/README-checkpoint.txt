Practical Aspects of Modern Cryptography Final Project

By Tahim Bhuiya


Overview:

This Python script provides a collection of cryptographic functionalities implemented in Python, including ElGamal encryption, DES encryption, 3DES encryption, Blum-Goldwasser encryption, and Hybridized encryption with ElGamal/DES and ElGamal/3DES.


Dependencies:
-Jupyter-Lab - This project was made with the assumption that the user has access to jupyter-lab and the instructions assume so as well. If you do not have jupyter-lab, either install it or find another way to run streamlit with the code with another IDE.

-Python 3.x

-streamlit - Download if not already in system. Can be downloaded with the command -pip install streamlit

-numpy - Download if not already in system.

-math - Download if not already in system.

-random - Download if not already in system.


Usage 

1. Clone the repository or download the code and open in Jupyter-lab. (I also provided a .txt file witht he code if you need to paste it.)

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using Python 

4. Open a terminal in the same directory while the code is up and type:
streamlit run Practical_Aspects_of_Modern_Cryptography_Final_Project.py

4. Follow the prompts for input on the different encryption schemes implemented and follow instructions carefully.

5. The script will generate keys, encrypt the plaintext, and decrypt the ciphertext, displaying the results depending on which scheme you are currently using.


The encryption schemes include:

ElGamal Encryption:

Run the script and select "ElGamal" from the encryption scheme options.

Follow instructions on scheme carefully for best result


DES Encryption:

Run the script and select "DES" from the encryption scheme options.

Follow instructions on scheme carefully for best result


3DES Encryption:

Run the script and select "3DES" from the encryption scheme options.

Follow instructions on scheme carefully for best result


Blum-Goldwasser Encryption:

Run the script and select "Blum-Goldwasser" from the encryption scheme options.

Follow instructions on scheme carefully for best result


Elgamal and DES (Hybrid):

Run the script and select "Elgamal and DES (Hybrid)" from the encryption scheme options.

Follow instructions on scheme carefully for best result


Elgamal and 3DES (Hybrid):

Run the script and select "Elgamal and 3DES (Hybrid)" from the encryption scheme options.

Follow instructions on scheme carefully for best result


Code Structure:

Contains all of the functions and commands necessary for running the encryption schemes in streamlit. 

Please do not alter any of the code as this may interfere with the application.
